                Hi, thanks for stopping by! My name is Jared and I'm a product designer hailing from the rainy Seattle, WA. 
                <br><br>
                I've always been fascinated by the intersection of design and technology. As a first-generation Filipino-American, this fascination has grown to become a passion for designing accessible and inclusive experiences that shape how underrepresented and marginalized communities function and grow. <br><br>
                Most recently, I was an Analyst Intern at <a href="https://boeing.com"" target="_blank"><b>Boeing</b></a> and I'm currently seeking internships and Entry-level jobs in UX while pursuing my Master's Degree.
                <br><br><br>
                <div class="pageSectionTitle">Background</div>
                Previously, I studied Information Systems at <a href=https://wsu.edu><b>Washington State University</b></a> where I focused on interdisciplinary Business applications of a wide range of technologies.<br><br>
                I worked as a tutor, I.T Supervisor, and <a href="https://mss.wsu.edu"><b>Webmaster</b></a> in addition to holding leadership positions in a variety of culturally-based student organizations. These experiences helped me emerge and hone my skills as a fearless creator, servant leader, and empathetic mentor. <br><br>
                Independently, I‚Äôve also provided design and development services for multiculturally-based student organizations, community action groups, and small businesses that share my same goal of empowering underrepresented groups. 
                <br><br><br>
                <div class="pageSectionTitle">Indulgences</div>
                Aside from design, you can probably find me <a href="https://soundcloud.com"><b>making music</b></a> taking care of my plants, or maintaing my island on¬†<i>Animal Crossing</i>. Other than that, I enjoy making playlists that you can listen to  <a href="https://spotify.com"><b>here</b></a>.
